# Deep Learning Analysis of EEG data

This repository contains all the resources and code for the project on detecting attention levels during coding tasks using EEG signals. The project employs deep learning techniques to extract features and patterns that indicate attention levels, and it includes preprocessing, feature extraction, and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) modeling.

## Overview
The project aims to understand the relationship between EEG signals and attention levels during coding tasks. By leveraging deep learning models, the project provides insights into cognitive states and their correlation with different coding activities.

## Data
The data folder contains EEG recordings in EDF format, collected during various coding tasks. The data is zipped and can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1nyJV8doPMgnec1V8k5bnObuT3tnygcyH).

## Code
The code is provided in a Jupyter Notebook (`EEG_Internship.ipynb`) and includes all the preprocessing, feature extraction, and modeling steps. You can run the notebook in Google Colab or a local Jupyter environment.

## Report
A detailed report on the project is available in PDF format, generated from LaTeX in Overleaf. The report includes the background, plan, process, and results of the project. You can find the report [here](https://www.overleaf.com/read/kcvjtkyhnhdw).

## Presentation
The presentation file (`EEG_Internship.pptx`) provides a visual summary of the project, suitable for conferences or meetings. It covers the main aspects of the project in a concise and engaging manner.
